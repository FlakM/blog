Topic: Impossible case of pitching rust in a web dev shop 

TLDR: Rust is a tough sell for JVM/python heavy companies with a lot of experience and actively maintained legacy code.
Sadly I don't think it's a good idea.

I've recently decided to collect my thoughts and arguments for pitching rust.
I tried to consider both sides - technology and business value.

Articles links to many big tech articles describing rust success stories (MS, AWS, Discord, Cloudflare).
During my research, I've found it hard to find some stories from not-so-small to medium-sized companies.
If you have some war stories or remarks I'd be very happy to include them in the article. 

I would be more than happy to be proved wrong BTW... :<
