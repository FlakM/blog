Hey, my name is Maciek and I'm a programmer since 2015.
I've gotten the chance to work in a large corporation and a small start-up.

I've found out that I want to look at terminals a lot during a completely
unrelated major in finance. I've managed to finish both of them but out
of pure decency (coding was more fun I guess).


As for technologies: I've been coding in scala but got to use a lot of
technologies like docker, other languages, networking, etc.
For a couple of years, I've become more and more fascinated with FOSS,
Linux and recently Rust.
