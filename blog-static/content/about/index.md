Hey, my name is Maciek. I'm a husband, dad, minimalist and technology nerd.

I've found out that I enjoy looking at terminals a lot during a completely unrelated major in finance. 

I'm passinate about building software that is:

- high quality ✅
- reliable 🔒
- on time ⏰
- easy to maintain 🛠️

I've always worked on networked, critical backend applications. I enjoy debugging hard problems and I'm absolutely nuts about my tooling.
