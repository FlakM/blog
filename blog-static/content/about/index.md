Hey, my name is Maciek. I'm a husband, dad, minimalist and technology nerd.

I've found out that I want to look at terminals a lot during a completely
unrelated major in finance. 

I've always worked on networked, critical backend applications.
I enjoy debugging hard problems and I'm absolutely nuts about my tooling.
