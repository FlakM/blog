Hey, my name is Maciek. I'm a minimalist, husband, dad and technology nerd.

I've found out that I want to look at terminals a lot during a completely
unrelated major in finance. I've managed to finish both of them but out
of pure decency and spite (coding was more fun I guess).

I've always worked on networked applications, mainly on backend.
I enjoy debugging hard problems and I'm absolutely nuts about my tooling.
